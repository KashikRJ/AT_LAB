The literature survey across the twelve papers reveals a consensus on the growing necessity for advanced personal finance management tools that leverage technology to enhance user experience, accuracy, and efficiency. A prevalent research gap identified is the integration of comprehensive financial management solutions into everyday life, bridging the divide between traditional manual tracking and modern digital automation. While several papers propose innovative applications for tracking expenses, utilizing OCR technology, and applying AI for personalized financial advice, there remains a gap in seamlessly integrating these solutions with users' financial ecosystems. This includes a lack of emphasis on holistic financial health, where expense tracking, budget planning, savings goals, and investment strategies are interconnected within a single platform. Additionally, there is a notable absence of solutions that effectively incorporate the dynamics of household budgeting, shared expenses, and the management of variable income streams, particularly for gig economy participants. Furthermore, the literature points to an opportunity for enhancing user engagement through more predictive analytics, personalized financial insights, and gamification strategies to encourage healthier financial behaviors. Addressing these gaps could significantly contribute to the development of more holistic, user-centric financial management tools that cater to the diverse needs of modern users, promoting financial literacy and stability in a technologically evolving landscape.
